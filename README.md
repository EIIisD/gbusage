# ㎇usage 🇬🇧

This is a fork of the repository `ccusage` but for people who live on a small island off of the coast of Europe that once ruled half the world.

It has many uses but the main and tested purpose is to provide a status line for claude code in GBP rather than USD.

It does this by utilising a free currency exchange conversion API, which it polls every 10 minutes or so.
