# ㎇usage 🇬🇧

A fork of the repository `ccusage` for people who live on a small island off-of the coast of Europe that once ruled half the known world.

It has many uses but the primary and tested purpose is to provide a status line for anthropics/claude-code in £GBP rather than $USD through a free currency exchange conversion API.
